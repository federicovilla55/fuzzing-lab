Fuzzing is a proven technique for uncovering memory‚Äêsafety and logic bugs in
C/C++ code. In this assignment we chose \texttt{tmux}, an open-source terminal
multiplexer for Unix-like systems, as our target because it (1) has a relatively
small OSS-Fuzz integration (only one harness), (2) shows very low runtime
coverage, and (3) is widely used daily by developers and DevOps engineers across
countless systems. By improving its fuzzing harness, we aim both to increase
\texttt{tmux}'s coverage under OSS-Fuzz and to demonstrate how targeted harness
modifications can uncover real bugs in a piece of critical infrastructure.
